# NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::MinimumVersion - Release tests for minimum required versions

# VERSION

version 2.000004

# SYNOPSIS

In `dist.ini`:

    [Test::MinimumVersion]
    max_target_perl = 5.10.1

# DESCRIPTION

This is an extension of [Dist::Zilla::Plugin::InlineFiles](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Dist::Zilla::Plugin::InlineFiles), providing a
[Test::MinimumVersion](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Test::MinimumVersion) test:

    xt/release/minimum-version.t - a standard Test::MinimumVersion test

You should provide the highest perl version you want to require as
`target_max_version`. If you accidentally use perl features that are newer
than that version number, then the test will fail, and you can go change
whatever bumped up the minimum perl version required.
